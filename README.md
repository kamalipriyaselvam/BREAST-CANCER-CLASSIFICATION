# BREAST-CANCER-CLASSIFICATION

I have applied the Machine Learning approach of KNN algorithms to classify the tumor cells as benign or malignant on the Breast Cancer (Wisconsin) database.

KNN algorithm works on the assumption that similar things exist in close proximity or similar things are assumed to be closer to each other. 

It is an easy to implement algorithm, that works well for both regression and classification based problems.

This end to end model is build and trained based on the parameters of WISCONSIN dataset.The dataset is available in kaggle.

And front end is build using streamlit.Refer Streamlit "https://streamlit.io/" for designing better UI.

Techy things used:

   %Python3.10.5

   %Pandas
   
   %Numpy
   
   %streamlit
